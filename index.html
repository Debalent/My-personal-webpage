        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Demond Balentine</strong>. I was born in Detroit, MI, and have lived in Newport, AR, on and off as a teen. I have served in both the Navy and Army. Currently, I am 48 years old, married, and a proud father of six children.

        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <p>
            I obtained my GED from Gary Job Corps Center in San Marcos, TX, in 1994. I briefly attended the University of Central Arkansas but left after one semester to support my new family. My background is in customer service, and I am now expanding my skills in software development.
